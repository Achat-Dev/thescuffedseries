      <p>Because I was unable to actually finish and release a game for the past four years, I am challenging myself to create a series of really small and simple games, collecting them here as <code>The Scuffed Series</code> (because they are probably gonna be pretty scuffed).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Disclaimer: These games are not meant to be groundbreaking by any means, I just want to get over my perfectionism and scoping issues :)</p>

      <h2>The Scuffed Series - A Clickers Nightmare</h2>
      <p>2/5 - Pretty scuffed</p>
      <p>Hover over shapes and press the matching buttons to destroy them. Pressing the correct button awards points while pressing the wrong button costs a live. The goal is to break your highscore.</p>

      <h2>The Scuffed Series 2 - Lava underneath you</h2>
      <p>3/5 - Not the best, not the worst</p>
      <p>You are standing on an unstable platform surrounded by lava and boxes start falling from the sky. Throw the boxes into the lava to prevent the platform from sinking. The goal is to survive as long as possible.</p>
