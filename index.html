    <p>Because I was unable to actually finish a release a game for the past four years, I am challenging myself to create a series of really small and simple games, collecting them here as <code>The Scuffed Series</code>.</p>

    <p>Disclaimer: These games are not meant to be groundbreaking by any means, I just want to get over my perfectionism and scoping issues :)</p>
